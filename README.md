## üéÆ Controls

- **‚Üê / ‚Üí** or **A / D** ‚Äî move left / right  
- **‚Üì** or **S** ‚Äî soft drop  
- **Space** ‚Äî hard drop  
- **‚Üë / W / X** ‚Äî rotate clockwise  
- **Z** ‚Äî rotate counter-clockwise  
- **P** ‚Äî pause / resume  
- **R** ‚Äî restart (New Game)

> Buttons are mouse-clickable too, but they‚Äôre deliberately unfocusable so Space never triggers them.

## üß† Gameplay rules & scoring

- **7-bag** randomizer (each set of I, J, L, O, S, T, Z shuffled then queued).
- **Line-clear points:**  
  `SCORE_BY_ROWS = [0, 100, 300, 500, 800]` and each award is multiplied by the **current level**.
- **Drop bonuses (only if at least one line was cleared by the lock):**
  - **Soft drop:** `+1` per cell descended via soft drop.
  - **Hard drop:** `+2` per cell descended via hard drop.
- **Level up:** every **10** cleared lines (`level = 1 + floor(cleared / 10)`).
- **Speed:** fall interval = `max(100ms, 800ms - (level - 1) * 60ms)`.
- **Game Over:** after a piece locks, if the *preview* piece would collide at the spawn position on the updated board, the game enters **Game Over**. Only **R** (restart) and **New Game** work.
